abstract = {Impedance cardiography is a low-cost noninvasive technique, based on monitoring of the thoracic impedance, for estimation of stroke volume (SV). Impedance cardiogram (ICG) is the negative of the first derivative of the impedance signal. A technique for beat-to-beat SV estimation using impedance cardiography and artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. A three-layer feed-forward ANN with error back-propagation algorithm is optimized by examining the effects of number of neurons in the hidden layer, activation function, training algorithm, and set of input parameters. The input parameters are obtained by automatic detection of the ICG characteristic points, and the target values are obtained by beat-to-beat SV measurements from time-aligned Doppler echocardiogram. The technique is evaluated using an ICG-echocardiography database with recordings from subjects with normal health in the under-rest and post-exercise conditions and from subjects with cardiovascular disorders in the under-rest condition. The proposed technique performed much better than the earlier established equation-based estimations, and it resulted in correlation coefficient of 0.93 for recordings from subjects with cardiovascular disorders. It may be helpful in improving the acceptability of impedance cardiography in clinical practice. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

abstract = {Goal: This paper presents a fast and accurate patient-specific electrocardiogram (ECG) classification and monitoring system. Methods: An adaptive implementation of 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is inherently used to fuse the two major blocks of the ECG classification into a single learning body: feature extraction and classification. Therefore, for each patient, an individual and simple CNN will be trained by using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, and thus, such patient-specific feature extraction ability can further improve the classification performance. Since this also negates the necessity to extract hand-crafted manual features, once a dedicated CNN is trained for a particular patient, it can solely be used to classify possibly long ECG data stream in a fast and accurate manner or alternatively, such a solution can conveniently be used for real-time ECG monitoring and early alert system on a light-weight wearable device. Results: The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a superior classification performance than most of the state-of-the-art methods for the detection of ventricular ectopic beats and supraventricular ectopic beats. Conclusion: Besides the speed and computational efficiency achieved, once a dedicated CNN is trained for an individual patient, it can solely be used to classify his/her long ECG records such as Holter registers in a fast and accurate manner. Significance: Due to its simple and parameter invariant nature, the proposed system is highly generic, and, thus, applicable to any ECG dataset.},

@article{Bruyant2002,
abstract = {During normal breathing, heart motion is about 15 mm along the body axis in humans. In this paper, we propose a method to track and to correct this motion after a list-mode acquisition which involves the recording of a signal proportional to respiratory volume. We use the dynamic MCAT (DMCAT) chest phantom to simulate 24 temporal frames regularly spaced during the respiratory cycle, for 60 projection angles over 360°. A 15-mm respiratory translation motion is simulated for the heart, liver and spleen. Thresholding of projections is used to reduce the influence of static activity on calculation of the axial center-of-mass (aCOM). Variation in the impact of attenuation as a function of projections and noise in the low-count projections rebinned from list-mode acquisitions is seen to limit ones ability to track respiratory motion using the aCOM. By including the recording of a signal proportional to the relative respiratory volume with the list-mode acquisition counts from different respiratory cycles can be combined to produce projections with common respiratory volumes. We have determined that the aCOMs determined from summing these common-volume based projections over the anterior to left-anterior oblique projection angles can be used to track respiratory motion as a function of the volume signal. Using this information on the variation of the aCOM as a function of the volume signal, the entire list-mode acquisition can then be rebinned into a projection set which is corrected for respiratory motion. After motion tracking, the mean absolute difference between the true motion curve and the aCOM curve is 0.10 cm for noisy studies. After correction no heart motion is visible on a cine display of projections. The polar map of myocardial MIBI uptake after motion correction is closer to that obtained when no respiratory motion is present than without correction.},

It was found that the mSFLC and mEA could compensate for drawbacks of the SFLC and precisely reproduce the impedance waveforms; however, misinterpretation and attenuation in the cardiac variables may be caused when abrupt changes or irregularities occur in the source waveform. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and reducing personal and economic costs, particularly where early treatment is geared towards preventing lower extremity amputation. New diagnostic tools are needed to enable this earlier intervention. We have developed a new low-cost, easy to use, non-invasive hemodynamic monitor, HeMo, to address this large and growing problem. Using a novel combination of impedance tomography and electrical volumetric measurements we can calculate real-time changes in peripheral blood volume. We believe that this work will lead to the availability of a fast, easy to use and cost-effective vascular assessment tool, dramatically shortening the time to diagnosis and subsequently intervention, dramatically improving the prognosis of affected patients.},

abstract = {Background Automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in electrocardiograms (ECGs) is beneficial for AF diagnosis, therapy, and management. In this article, a novel method of AF detection is introduced. Most current methods only utilize the RR interval as a critical parameter to detect AF; thus, these methods commonly confuse AF with other arrhythmias. Methods We used the average number of f waves in a TQ interval as a characteristic parameter in our robust, real-time AF detection method. Three types of clinical ECG data, including ECGs from normal, AF, and non-AF arrhythmia subjects, were downloaded from multiple open access databases to validate the proposed method. Results The experimental results suggested that the method could distinguish between AF and normal ECGs with accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive values (PPVs) of 93.67{\%}, 94.13{\%}, and 98.69{\%}, respectively. These values are comparable to those of related methods. The method was also able to distinguish between AF and non-AF arrhythmias and had performance indexes (accuracy 94.62{\%}, sensitivity 94.13{\%}, and PPVs 97.67{\%}) that were considerably better than those of other methods. Conclusions Our proposed method has prospects as a practical tool enabling clinical diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of AF. {\textcopyright}2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This study is the first in comparing this non-invasive technique in measuring stroke volume with established techniques. The objective of this study was to validate EIT variables derived from the EIT images with paired obtained stroke volume measurements by thermodilution and MRI. After right cardiac catheterization, EIT measurements were performed in 25 patients. Regression analysis was used to analyse the relation between the EIT results and stroke volume determined by thermodilution. From the regression line an equation was derived to estimate stroke volume (in ml) by EIT. A strong correlation was found between EIT and stroke volume measured by the thermodilution method (r = 0.86). In a group of 11 healthy subjects this equation was validated to MRI. The mean and standard deviation of the difference between EIT and MRI was 0.7 ml and 5.4 ml respectively. These data indicate that EIT is a valid and reproducible method for the assessment of stroke volume.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Noninvasive evaluation of arterial compliance by measurement of Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) has proven utility in cardiovascular screening. We present the design of a novel Magnetic PlethysmoGraph (MPG) for non-invasive estimation of PWV. The system uses a Giant Magneto Resistance (GMR) sensor to detect the fluctuations caused by blood flow in an ambient magnetic field encompassing the blood vessel. The design of an Electro Magnet (EM) based MPG transducer is presented. The ability of the proposed transducer to detect the blood pulse waveform is verified by in-vivo tests and an occlusion test. The design is further validated by demonstrating in-vivo measurements of carotid to radial artery PWV. The design of a dual element transducer for evaluation of local PWV is also presented. The proposed dual element plethysmograph is capable of measuring PWV over sections of the arterial tree as small as 15 mm. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The design of a portable device for heart rate monitoring is described in this work. The cardiac activity is detected through the noninvasively measurement of blood volume changes in the forearm. When blood volume arrives to the forearm from the left ventricle, the electrical properties of the body segment change. These changes, that mainly comprise the electrical impedance of the tissue, are measured through the injection of a safely ac current and the detection of the voltage changes due to blood flow. Such a method is known as electrical impedance plethysmography. A peak-detection-software is used in a microcontroller to estimate the heart rate. Results of measuring the heart rate have shown accuracy that accomplishes the AAMI standards for heart rate monitors.},

abstract = {The study's goal was to determine if cardiac output (CO), obtained by impedance cardiography (ICG), would be improved by a new equation N, implementing a square root transformation for dZ/dtmax/Z0, and a variable magnitude, mass-based volume conductor Vc. Pulmonary artery catheterisation was performed on 106 cardiac surgery patients pre-operatively. Post-operatively, thermodilution cardiac output (TDCO) was simultaneously compared with ICG CO.dZ/dtmax/Z0 and Z0 were obtained from a proprietary bioimpedance device. The impedance variables, in addition to left ventricular ejection time TLVE and patient height and weight, were input using four stroke volume (SV) equations: Kubicek (K), Sramek (S), Sramek-Bernstein (SB), and a new equation N. CO was calculated as SV × heart rate. Data are presented as mean ± SD. One way repeated measures of ANOVA followed by the Tukey test were used for inter-group comparisons. Bland-Altman methods were used to assess bias, precision and limits of agreement. P {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. CO implementing N (6.06 ± 1.48/min-1) was not different from TDCO (5.97 ± 1.41/min-1). By contrast, CO calculated using K (3.70 ± 1.53/min-1), S (4.16 ± 1.83/min-1) and SB (4.37 ± 1.82/min-1) was significantly less than TDCO. Bland-Altman analysis showed poor agreement between TDCO and K, S and SB, but not between TDCO and N. Compared with TDCO, equation N, using a square-root transformation for dZ/dtmax/Z0, and a mass-based Vc, was superior to existing transthoracic impedance techniques for SV and CO determination. {\textcopyright} IFMBE: 2005.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review Adequate oxygen delivery is essential for life, with hypoxia resulting in dysfunction, and ultimately death, of the cells, organs and organism. Blood flow delivers the oxygen bound in the blood, while haemodynamics is the science of blood flow. Stroke volume (SV) is the fundamental unit of blood flow, and reflects the interdependent perfor-mance of the heart, the vessels and the autonomic nervous system. However, haemodynamic management remains gen-erally poor and predominantly guided by simple blood pres-sure observations alone. Recent Findings Doppler ultrasound measures SV with un-equalled clinical precision when operated by trained person-nel. Combining SV with BP measurements allows calculation of flow-pressure based measures which better reflect cardio-vascular performance and allows personalised physiologic and pathophysiologic modelling consistent with Frank's and Starling's observations. Summary Doppler SV monitoring and novel flow-pressure parameters may improve our understanding of the cardiovascular system and lead to improved diagnosis and therapy. This review examines the physics and practice of Doppler SV monitoring and its application in advanced haemodynamics.},

abstract = {A novel solution of electrical bio-impedance (EBI) analyzers with suppression of errors caused by higher odd harmonics of rectangular wave pulses, is proposed. The solution is based on a special method of shortening the rectangular pulses commonly used in the correlation type or lock-in EBI measurements. Comparison of the proposed method with using of regular square wave pulses is given. The results show that the errors of frequency response measurement of a three element EBI equivalent will become tens of times smaller when shortening the excitation and reference signals by 30?? and 18??, respectively. Also, much simpler cases, as shortening of only one of the signals (excitation or reference one) by 30?? give acceptable results. Acceptable accuracy of the phasor measurement of EBI makes the method reliable for the most clinical applications. Thank to its simplicity, the method is suitable for on-chip realization in implantable devices. ?? 2005 IEEE.},

Testing of these algorithms should be done by using a large amount of annotated data under equal conditions. For our investigation we simulated a continuous analysis by selecting the data in steps of one second without any preselection. We used the BIH-MIT arrhythmia, the CU, and the AHA database. For a new ventricular fibrillation detection algorithm we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and the area under its receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and compared these values with the results from an earlier investigation of several different ventricular fibrillation detection algorithms.

Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provides high quality imaging of the left ventricle in patients on ventilators [12]. In addition, manipulation of the probe is performed near the patient's head and so does not interfere with the surgeon's job. This enables echocardiographic monitoring of left ventricular function throughout the operation. The information so obtained not only provides data about anatomical changes which is sometimes invaluable, but also allows quantification of left ventricular function which is the main advantage for anaesthetists. The images allow study of regional and global left ventricular contraction and the deduction of certain parameters of ventricular performance. The ability to perform real time monitoring of ventricular function throughout anaesthesia and the immediate postoperative period is all the more valuable in patients with limited cardiac and coronary reserve. This new method of monitoring gives a better understanding of the physiopathology of peroperative cardiac events and provides information which may guide the conduct of the anaesthesia and postoperative care. {\textcopyright} 1987 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.},

abstract = {The preejection period (PEP) is an index of left ventricle contractility widely used in psychophysiological research. Its computation requires detecting the moment when the aortic valve opens, which coincides with the B point in the first derivative of impedance cardiogram (ICG). Although this operation has been traditionally made via visual inspection, several algorithms based on derivative calculations have been developed to enable an automatic performance of the task. However, despite their popularity, data about their empirical validation are not always available. The present study analyzes the performance in the estimation of the aortic valve opening of three popular algorithms, by comparing their performance with the visual detection of the B point made by two independent scorers. Algorithm 1 is based on the first derivative of the ICG, Algorithm 2 on the second derivative, and Algorithm 3 on the third derivative. Algorithm 3 showed the highest accuracy rate (78.77{\%}), followed by Algorithm 1 (24.57{\%}) and Algorithm 2 (13.82{\%}). In the automatic computation of PEP, Algorithm 2 resulted in significantly more missed cycles (48.57{\%}) than Algorithm 1 (6.3{\%}) and Algorithm 3 (3.5{\%}). Algorithm 2 also estimated a significantly lower average PEP (70 ms), compared with the values obtained by Algorithm 1 (119 ms) and Algorithm 3 (113 ms). Our findings indicate that the algorithm based on the third derivative of the ICG performs significantly better. Nevertheless, a visual inspection of the signal proves indispensable, and this article provides a novel visual guide to facilitate the manual detection of the B point.},

abstract = {Traditional mobile login methods, like numerical or graphical passwords, are vulnerable to passive attacks. It is common for intruders to gain access to personal information of their victims by watching them enter their passwords into their mobile screens from a close proximity. With this in mind, a mobile biometric authentication algorithm based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is proposed. With this algorithm, the user will only need to touch two ECG electrodes (lead I) of the mobile device to gain access. The algorithm was tested with a cell phone case heart monitor in a controlled laboratory experiment at different times and conditions with ten subjects and also with 73 records obtained from the Physionet database. The obtained results reveal that our algorithm has 1.41{\%} false acceptance rate and 81.82{\%} true acceptance rate with 4 s of signal acquisition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach on mobile authentication that uses ECG biometric signals and it shows a promising future for this technology. Nonetheless, further improvements are still needed to optimize accuracy while maintaining a short acquisition time for authentication.},

abstract = {Many diagnostic methods have been developed so far for the purpose of detecting such fault-related signals. These methods come from different types and areas of science and technology, and can be summarized as follows (Jardine et al., 2006) (Meador, 2003): 1. Electromagnetic field monitoring by means of search coils, and coils placed around motor shafts (axial flux-related detection). This is associated with the capacity for capturing the presence of magnetic fields around an IM. Field evaluation must provide information about motor-operation states. 2. Temperature measurements: Temperature is a typical second-order effect of operation conditions. Induction motors typically have an operational temperature range, defined in the motor nameplate, which is associated with the tests performed. Any faultoperation condition shows a temperature increment. By performing a temperature analysis the first approach to fault conditions can be made. 3. Infrared recognition: This is used to evaluate the state of the material, especially for bearings. This cannot be performed in an online system. 4. Radio frequency (RF) emissions monitoring: Radio frequency is a second-order effect of fault conditions which is currently used for gearbox diagnosis. 5. Vibration monitoring: This is the typical method for fault diagnosis in industrial applications; it achieves good results for bearing analysis although it presents some deficiencies with electrical faults and rotor faults. 6. Chemical analysis: This is used to analyze bearing grease; it is only used with big motors and not with the typical small ones. 7. Acoustic noise measurement: This is a new trend in the field of gearbox failure (Tahori et al., 2007). 8. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA), which is explained further below. 9. Model-based artificial intelligence and neural-network-based techniques: These are new approaches which combine multi-modal data acquisition with advanced signalprocessing techniques.},

B-point detection accuracy can be severely impacted if ICG cardiac cycles corrupted by motion artifact, noise, or electrode displacement are included in the analyses. Here, we developed new algorithms to detect and exclude corrupted ICG cycles by analyzing their level of activity. PEP was then estimated and analyzed on ensemble-averaged clean ICG cycles using an automatic algorithm previously developed by the authors for the detection of B point in awake individuals. We investigated the algorithms' performance relative to expert visual scoring on long-duration data collected from 20 participants during overnight recordings, where the quality of ICG could be highly affected by movement artifacts and electrode displacements and the signal could also vary according to sleep stage and time of night. The artifact rejection algorithm achieved a high accuracy of 87{\%} in detection of expert-identified corrupted ICG cycles, including those with normal amplitude as well as out-of-range values, and was robust to different types and levels of artifact. Intraclass correlations for concurrent validity of the B-point detection algorithm in different sleep stages and in-bed wakefulness exceeded 0.98, indicating excellent agreement with the expert. The algorithms show promise toward sleep applications requiring accurate and reliable automatic measurement of cardiac hemodynamic parameters.},

abstract = {The objective of a continuous authentication system is to continuously monitor the identity of subjects using biometric systems. In this paper, we proposed a novel feature extraction and a unique continuous authentication strategy and technique. We proposed One-Dimensional Multi-Resolution Local Binary Patterns (1DMRLBP), an online feature extraction for one-dimensional signals. We also proposed a continuous authentication system, which uses sequential sampling and 1DMRLBP feature extraction. This system adaptively updates decision thresholds and sample size during run-time. Unlike most other local binary patterns variants, 1DMRLBP accounts for observations' temporal changes and has a mechanism to extract one feature vector that represents multiple observations. 1DMRLBP also accounts for quantization error, tolerates noise, and extracts local and global signal morphology. This paper examined electrocardiogram signals. When 1DMRLBP was applied on the University of Toronto database (UofTDB) 1,012 single session subjects database, an equal error rate (EER) of 7.89{\%} was achieved in comparison to 12.30{\%} from a state-of-the-art work. Also, an EER of 10.10{\%} was resulted when 1DMRLBP was applied to UofTDB 82 multiple sessions database. Experiments showed that using 1DMRLBP improved EER by 15{\%} when compared with a biometric system based on raw time-samples. Finally, when 1DMRLBP was implemented with sequential sampling to achieve a continuous authentication system, 0.39{\%} false rejection rate and 1.57{\%} false acceptance rate were achieved.},

Atherosclerosis is a vital coronary disease in which plaque (a solid substance made of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances found in blood) builds up inside the arteries and can lead to serious problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death. In this work, a non-invasive imaging technique based on the variation of electrical conductivity (and/or relative permittivity) values of the body tissues have been proposed for detection of atherosclerosis. Here, we have modeled the 2D structure of vessels within a closed specified environment. The 2D model is then transformed to 3D platform for analysis. The clots inside the blood vessels have varying electrical conductivities (and/or relative permittivity's) in comparison to that for the blood vessels. Thus, by maintaining a potential difference on the electrodes, which are placed on the body surface, the variation of potential field are obtained along a 2D plane by utilizing the forward solver problem of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). The simulation model and their respective studies are performed in Finite Element Method based Multiphysics Software platform.},

To this end, we ranked the influence of tissues by performing repetitive forward calculations while varying the respective tissue conductivity. The torso model included all major anatomical structures like blood, lungs, fat, anisotropic skeletal muscle, intestine, liver, kidneys, bone, cartilage, and spleen. Cardiac electrical sources were derived from realistic atrial and ventricular simulations. The conductivity rankings were based on one of two methods: First, we considered fixed percental conductivity changes to probe the sensitivity of the ECG regarding conductivity alterations. Second, we set conductivities to the reported minimum and maximum values to evaluate the effects of the existing conductivity uncertainties. The amplitudes of both atrial and ventricular ECGs were most sensitive for blood, skeletal muscle conductivity and anisotropy as well as for heart, fat, and lungs. If signal morphology was considered, fat was more important whereas skeletal muscle was less important. When comparing atria and ventricles, the lungs had a larger effect on the atria yet the heart conductivity had a stronger impact on the ventricles. The effects of conductivity uncertainties were significant. Future studies dealing with electrocardiographic simulations should consider these effects. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Abstract The accurate quantification of cardiac output (CO) is given vital importance in modern medical practice, especially in high‑risk surgical and critically ill patients. CO monitoring together with perioperative protocols to guide intravenous fluid therapy and inotropic support with the aim of improving CO and oxygen delivery has shown to improve perioperative outcomes in high‑risk surgical patients. Understanding of the underlying principles of CO measuring devices helps in knowing the limitations of their use and allows more effective and safer utilization. At present, no single CO monitoring device can meet all the clinical requirements considering the limitations of diverse CO monitoring techniques. The evidence for the minimally invasive CO monitoring is conflicting; however, different CO monitoring devices may be used during the clinical course of patients as an integrated approach based on their invasiveness and the need for additional hemodynamic data. These devices add numerical trend information for anesthesiologists and intensivists to use in determining the most appropriate management of their patients and at present, do not completely prohibit but do increasingly limit the use of the pulmonary artery catheter.},

abstract = {Minimally invasive beating-heart surgery offers substantial benefits for the patient, compared to conventional open surgery. Nevertheless, the motion of the heart poses increased requirements to the surgeon. To support the surgeon, algorithms for an advanced robotic surgery system are proposed, which offer motion compensation of the beating heart. This implies the measurement of heart motion, which can be achieved by tracking natural landmarks. In most cases, the investigated affine tracking scheme can be reduced to an efficient block matching algorithm allowing for realtime tracking of multiple landmarks. Fourier analysis of the motion parameters shows two dominant peaks, which correspond to the heart and respiration rates of the patient. The robustness in case of disturbance or occlusion can be improved by specially developed prediction schemes. Local prediction is well suited for the detection of single tracking outliers. A global prediction scheme takes several landmarks into account simultaneously and is able to bridge longer disturbances. As the heart motion is strongly correlated with the patient's electrocardiogram and respiration pressure signal, this information is included in a novel robust multisensor prediction scheme. Prediction results are compared to those of an artificial neural network and of a linear prediction approach, which shows the superior performance of the proposed algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

However, data collection and processing criteria have evolved in a myriad of ways out of the need to answer unique research questions; as a result there is no consensus. Objectives: The purpose of this review was to: (1) compile and classify existing studies assessing sedentary time, physical activity, energy expenditure, or sleep using the ActiGraph GT3X/+ through data collection and processing criteria to improve data comparability and (2) review data collection and processing criteria when using GT3X/+ and provide age-specific practical considerations based on the validation/calibration studies identified. Methods: Two independent researchers conducted the search in PubMed and Web of Science. We included all original studies in which the GT3X/+ was used in laboratory, controlled, or free-living conditions published from 1 January 2010 to the 31 December 2015. Results: The present systematic review provides key information about the following data collection and processing criteria: placement, sampling frequency, filter, epoch length, non-wear-time, what constitutes a valid day and a valid week, cut-points for sedentary time and physical activity intensity classification, and algorithms to estimate PAEE and sleep-related behaviors. The information is organized by age group, since criteria are usually age-specific. Conclusion: This review will help researchers and practitioners to make better decisions before (i.e., device placement and sampling frequency) and after (i.e., data processing criteria) data collection using the GT3X/+ accelerometer, in order to obtain more valid and comparable data.

In this work the effects of respiration on the cardiac position were studied quantitively by imaging the heart during diastole at various positions of tidal respiration with a breath‐hold segmented fast gradient echo technique. It was found that during tidal breathing the movement of the heart due to respiration is dominated by superior‐inferior (SI) motion, which is linearly related to the SI motion of the diaphragm. The motion of the heart due to respiration is approximately a global translation. These results provide motivation for employing adaptive motion correction techniques to reduce image blurring in nonbreath‐hold coronary MR imaging.

This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-It-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education.

abstract = {Background: A pivotal component in automated external defibrillators (AEDs) is the detection of ventricular fibrillation by means of appropriate detection algorithms. In scientific literature there exists a wide variety of methods and ideas for handling this task. These algorithms should have a high detection quality, be easily implementable, and work in real time in an AED. Testing of these algorithms should be done by using a large amount of annotated data under equal conditions. Methods: For our investigation we simulated a continuous analysis by selecting the data in steps of one second without any preselection. We used the complete BIH-MIT arrhythmia database, the CU database, and the files 7001 - 8210 of the AHA database. All algorithms were tested under equal conditions. Results: For 5 well-known standard and 5 new ventricular fibrillation detection algorithms we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and the area under their receiver operating characteristic. In addition, two QRS detection algorithms were included. These results are based on approximately 330 000 decisions (per algorithm). Conclusions: Our values for sensitivity and specificity differ from earlier investigations since we used no preselection. The best algorithm is a new one, presented here for the first time. {\textcopyright} 2005 Amann et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Gaw2010,
abstract = {Impedance cardiography is an application of bioimpedance analysis primarily used in a research setting to determine cardiac output. It is a non invasive technique that measures the change in the impedance of the thorax which is attributed to the ejection of a volume of blood from the heart. The cardiac output is calculated from the measured impedance using the parallel conductor theory and a constant value for the resistivity of blood. However, the resistivity of blood has been shown to be velocity dependent due to changes in the orientation of red blood cells induced by changing shear forces during flow. The overall goal of this thesis was to study the effect that flow deviations have on the electrical impedance of blood, both experimentally and theoretically, and to apply the results to a clinical setting. The resistivity of stationary blood is isotropic as the red blood cells are randomly orientated due to Brownian motion. In the case of blood flowing through rigid tubes, the resistivity is anisotropic due to the biconcave discoidal shape and orientation of the cells. The generation of shear forces across the width of the tube during flow causes the cells to align with the minimal cross sectional area facing the direction of flow. This is in order to minimise the shear stress experienced by the cells. This in turn results in a larger cross sectional area of plasma and a reduction in the resistivity of the blood as the flow increases. Understanding the contribution of this effect on the thoracic impedance change is a vital step in achieving clinical acceptance of impedance cardiography. Published literature investigates the resistivity variations for constant blood flow. In this case, the shear forces are constant and the impedance remains constant during flow at a magnitude which is less than that for stationary blood. The research presented in this thesis, however, investigates the variations in resistivity of blood during pulsataile flow through rigid tubes and the relationship between impedance, velocity and acceleration. Using rigid tubes isolates the impedance change to variations associated with changes in cell orientation only. The implications of red blood cell orientation changes for clinical impedance cardiography were also explored. This was achieved through measurement and analysis of the experimental impedance of pulsatile blood flowing through rigid tubes in a mock circulatory system. A novel theoretical model including cell orientation dynamics was developed for the impedance of pulsatile blood through rigid tubes. The impedance of flowing blood was theoretically calculated using analytical methods for flow through straight tubes and the numerical Lattice Boltzmann method for flow through complex geometries such as aortic valve stenosis. The result of the analytical theoretical model was compared to the experimental impedance measurements through rigid tubes. The impedance calculated for flow through a stenosis using the Lattice Boltzmann method provides results for comparison with impedance cardiography measurements collected as part of a pilot clinical trial to assess the suitability of using bioimpedance techniques to assess the presence of aortic stenosis. The experimental and theoretical impedance of blood was shown to inversely follow the blood velocity during pulsatile flow with a correlation of -0.72 and -0.74 respectively. The results for both the experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the acceleration of the blood is an important factor in determining the impedance, in addition to the velocity. During acceleration, the relationship between impedance and velocity is linear (r2 = 0.98, experimental and r2 = 0.94, theoretical). The relationship between the impedance and velocity during the deceleration phase is characterised by a time decay constant, {\^{o}} , ranging from 10 to 50 s. The high level of agreement between the experimental and theoretically modelled impedance demonstrates the accuracy of the model developed here. An increase in the haematocrit of the blood resulted in an increase in the magnitude of the impedance change due to changes in the orientation of red blood cells. The time decay constant was shown to decrease linearly with the haematocrit for both experimental and theoretical results, although the slope of this decrease was larger in the experimental case. The radius of the tube influences the experimental and theoretical impedance given the same velocity of flow. However, when the velocity was divided by the radius of the tube (labelled the reduced average velocity) the impedance response was the same for two experimental tubes with equivalent reduced average velocity but with different radii. The temperature of the blood was also shown to affect the impedance with the impedance decreasing as the temperature increased. These results are the first published for the impedance of pulsatile blood. The experimental impedance change measured orthogonal to the direction of flow is in the opposite direction to that measured in the direction of flow. These results indicate that the impedance of blood flowing through rigid cylindrical tubes is axisymmetric along the radius. This has not previously been verified experimentally. Time frequency analysis of the experimental results demonstrated that the measured impedance contains the same frequency components occuring at the same time point in the cycle as the velocity signal contains. This suggests that the impedance contains many of the fluctuations of the velocity signal. Application of a theoretical steady flow model to pulsatile flow presented here has verified that the steady flow model is not adequate in calculating the impedance of pulsatile blood flow. The success of the new theoretical model over the steady flow model demonstrates that the velocity profile is important in determining the impedance of pulsatile blood. The clinical application of the impedance of blood flow through a stenosis was theoretically modelled using the Lattice Boltzman method (LBM) for fluid flow through complex geometeries. The impedance of blood exiting a narrow orifice was calculated for varying degrees of stenosis. Clincial impedance cardiography measurements were also recorded for both aortic valvular stenosis patients (n = 4) and control subjects (n = 4) with structurally normal hearts. This pilot trial was used to corroborate the results of the LBM. Results from both investigations showed that the decay time constant for impedance has potential in the assessment of aortic valve stenosis. In the theoretically modelled case (LBM results), the decay time constant increased with an increase in the degree of stenosis. The clinical results also showed a statistically significant difference in time decay constant between control and test subjects (P = 0.03). The time decay constant calculated for test subjects ({\^{o}} = 180 - 250 s) is consistently larger than that determined for control subjects ({\^{o}} = 50 - 130 s). This difference is thought to be due to difference in the orientation response of the cells as blood flows through the stenosis. Such a non-invasive technique using the time decay constant for screening of aortic stenosis provides additional information to that currently given by impedance cardiography techniques and improves the value of the device to practitioners. However, the results still need to be verified in a larger study. While impedance cardiography has not been widely adopted clinically, it is research such as this that will enable future acceptance of the method.},

abstract = {This manuscript documents the alteration of the heart model of the three-dimensional (3D) mathematical cardiac torso (MCAT) phantom to represent cardiac motion. The objective of the inclusion of motion was to develop a digital simulation of the heart such that the impact of cardiac motion on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging could be assessed and methods of quantitating cardiac function could be investigated. The motion of the gated 3D MCAT's (gMCAT) heart is modeled using 128 separate and evenly spaced time samples from a blood volume curve approximating an average heart cycle. Sets of adjacent time samples can be grouped together to represent a single time interval within the heart cycle. Maximum and minimum chamber volumes were selected to be similar to those of a normal healthy person while the total heart volume stayed constant during the cardiac cycle. Myocardial mass was conserved during the cardiac cycle and the bases of the ventricles were modeled as moving towards the static apex. The orientation of the 3D MCAT heart was changed during contraction to rotate back and forth around the long axis through the center of the left ventricle (LV) using the end systolic time interval as the time point at which to reverse direction. Simple respiratory motion was also introduced by changing the orientation of the long axis of the heart to represent its variation with respiration. Heart models for 24 such orientations spanning the range of motion during the respiratory cycle were averaged together for each time sample to represent the blurring of the heart during the acquisition of multiple cardiac cycles. Finally, an option to model apical thinning of the myocardium was included. As an illustration of the application of the gMCAT phantom, the gated heart model was evaluated by measuring myocardial wall thickening. A linear relationship was obtained between maximum myocardial counts and myocardial thickness, similar to published results. Similar results were obtained for full width at half maximum (FWHM) measurements. With the presence of apical thinning, an apparent increase in counts in the apical region compared to the other heart walls in the absence of attenuation compensation turns into an apparent decrease in counts with attenuation compensation. The apical decrease was more prominent in end systole (ES) than end diastole (ED) due to the change in the partial volume effect. These observations agree with clinical trends. It is concluded that the gMCAT phantom can be used to study the influence of various physical parameters on radionuclide perfusion imaging.},

Methods: Fifty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I–III patients, aged 38–81 years, scheduled for off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled in this study. CO data (NCO, BCO, PCO) were recorded during the operative period at ten time points after stable hemodynamic conditions were achieved. Results: The equation of the relationship between the PCO and NCO is PCO = 0.945 × NCO + 0.328 (r = 0.77), and that of PCO and BCO is PCO = 0.965 × BCO + 0.729 (r = 0.63). Furthermore, no statistical difference was found between PCO versus NCO (mean (SD): 4.4 (1.1) versus 4.4 (0.9), p = 0.431). A significant correlation was found between PCO and NCO (r = 0.77, p {\textless} 0.001). Correlation was also found between PCO and BCO (r = 0.63, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: The NICOM device is a safe, convenient, and reliable device for measuring continuous non-invasive cardiac output and cardiac index, and the trends of change in CO during the surgery are similar between NICOM and PAC.},

Vascular diseases are the diseases which affect the blood vessels (arteries and veins) of the circulatory system, causing severe or fatal health problems. The most common vascular diseases are atherosclerosis, occlusion and swelling (aneurysm). Atherosclerosis is a disease in which the plaques build up on the inner vessel wall, while the swelling occurs when a part of vessel wall weakens and forms abnormal bulge called aneurysm. The objective of this paper is to validate the usage of non-invasive bio-impedance analysis in evaluating the vascular status and detecting various diseases. Mathematical models and finite elements models are used to correlate between the bioimpedance measurements and three vascular statuses; which are normal, stenosis and aneurysm. Moreover, multi-segments impedance measurements are carried out in this research to detect the infected segment of vessel.

However, the ICG signals are inherently susceptible to artificial noise interference, which leads to an inaccurate LVET measurement and then yields an error in the calculation of SV. Therefore, the goal of the study was to measure LVETs using both the transmission and reflection photoplethysmography (PPG), and to assess whether the measured LVET was more accurate by the PPG signal than the ICG signal. The LVET measured by the phonocardiography (PCG) was used as the standard for comparing with those by the ICG and PPG. The study recruited ten subjects whose LVETs were simultaneously measured by the ICG using four electrodes, the reflection PPG using neck sensors (PPG neck ) and the transmission PPG using finger sensors (PPG finger ). In each subject, ten LVETs were obtained from ten heartbeats selected properly from one-minute recording. The differences of the measured LVETs between the PCG and one of the ICG, PPG neck and PPG finger were −68.2 ± 148.6 ms, 4.8 ± 86.5 ms and −7.0 ± 107.5 ms, respectively. As compared with the PCG, both the ICG and PPG finger underestimated but the PPG neck overestimated the LVETs. Furthermore, the measured LVET by the PPG neck was the closest to that by the PCG. Therefore, the PPG neck may be employed to improve the LVET measurement in applying the ICG for continuous monitoring of SV in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Early recognition of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and electrical therapy are key for the survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated with automated external defibrillators (AED). AED algorithms for VF-detection are customarily assessed using Holter recordings from public electrocardiogram (ECG) databases, which may be different from the ECG seen during OHCA events. This study evaluates VF-detection using data from both OHCA patients and public Holter recordings. ECG-segments of 4-s and 8-s duration were analyzed. For each segment 30 features were computed and fed to state of the art machine learning (ML) algorithms. ML-algorithms with built-in feature selection capabilities were used to determine the optimal feature subsets for both databases. Patient-wise bootstrap techniques were used to evaluate algorithm performance in terms of sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and balanced error rate (BER). Performance was significantly better for public data with a mean Se of 96.6{\%}, Sp of 98.8{\%} and BER 2.2{\%} compared to a mean Se of 94.7{\%}, Sp of 96.5{\%} and BER 4.4{\%} for OHCA data. OHCA data required two times more features than the data from public databases for an accurate detection (6 vs 3). No significant differences in performance were found for different segment lengths, the BER differences were below 0.5-points in all cases. Our results show that VF-detection is more challenging for OHCA data than for data from public databases, and that accurate VF-detection is possible with segments as short as 4-s.},

abstract = {In order to elucidate the beat-to-beat changes of the systolic time intervals (STI) during exercise, we proposed new techniques relating to an adaptive filter and detection algorithms for B- and X-points in the impedance cardiograph (ICG). Six male subjects underwent a ramp bicycle exercise up to maximum intensity during which an ECG, ICG and phonocardiogram (PCG) were continuously measured. Following the application of an adaptive filter, the scaled Fourier linear combiner (SFLC), to the first derivative (dZ/dt) of the base impedance ($\Delta$Z) and PCG waveforms, the B- and X-points were automatically determined. For the B-point detection we used three criteria: the zero-crossing point (B zero ), the 15{\%} response point (B 15{\%} ) of the negative peak of the dZ/dt (dZ/dt min ) and a new algorithm (B new ). The X-point was separately determined by using the ICG and PCG waveforms. It was found that the shape of the dZ/dt waveform directly affected the determination of the B- and X-points. The B-points determined using B zero and B 15{\%} criteria were sometimes unstable caused by the location of a notch preceding the dZ/dt min compared to the B new . The time difference between the X-points measured by the ICG and PCG was mostly within ± 20 milliseconds but statistically significant. Although a wide variation was seen in R-R intervals, the STI were more stable. The relationships between HR and STI from rest to maximal exercise showed a gentle curvilinear relationship. It is suggested that the STI can be obtained precisely on a beat-to-beat basis by using the adaptive filter and detection algorithms for the inflection points of the ICG even during maximum exercise. {\textcopyright} 2004 Tohoku University Medical Press.},

abstract = {The impedance cardiography (ICG) is widely used for beat-to-beat noninvasive evaluation of the left ventricular stroke volume and contractility. It implies the correct determination of the ejection start and end points and the amplitudes of certain peaks in the differentiated impedance cardiogram. An accurate identification of ejection onset by ICG is often problematic, especially in the cardiologic patients, due to peculiar waveforms. Using a simple theoretical model, we tested the hypothesis that two major processes are responsible for the formation of impedance systolic wave: (1) the changes in the heart geometry and surrounding vessels produced by ventricular contraction, which occur during the isovolumic phase and precede ejection, and (2) expansion of aorta and adjacent arteries during the ejection phase. The former process initiates the preejection wave WpE and the latter triggers the ejection wave WEj. The model predicts a potential mechanism of generating the abnormal shapes of dZ/dt due to the presence of preejection waves and explains the related errors in ICG time and amplitude parameters. An appropriate decomposition method is a promising way to avoid the masking effects of these waves and a further step to correct determination of the onset of ejection and the corresponding peak amplitudes from 'pathologically shaped' ICG signals.},

The chest wall of the pig was opened, the sensor sutured to the heart, and motion data was recorded over several hours. The heart's own beating is partly concealed by other sources of motion, particularly the respiration. High-pass filtering was used to isolate the heart beating from these other motions. The filter cut-off frequency was set to 1.0 Hz, including the heart rate at 1.5 Hz, while suppressing the respiration at 0.3 Hz. Velocity and position were obtained by numerically integrating the filtered acceleration traces. Using this procedure, the heart motion could be measured in great detail. Motion abnormalities, e.g. arrhythmias and fibrillation, were identified in the motion curves, and confirmed by comparison with synchronously recorded ECG data. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = {The aim of our study was to determine the validity of cardiac output (CO) measurements taken with the ultrasonic cardiac output monitor (USCOM) by comparing to CO measured by pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC) thermodilution during cardiac catheterization. We enrolled thirty-one children ({\textless}18 years) undergoing cardiac catheterization in this double-blinded, prospective, observational study. The median CO measured by USCOM was 4.37 L/min (IQR 3.73, 5.60 L/min) compared to 4.28 L/min (IQR 3.52, 5.26 L/min) by PAC thermodilution. The bias (mean difference) between the two methods was 0.2 L/min, and the 95 {\%} limits of agreement were −1.2 to 1.6 L/min. The mean percentage error of CO between USCOM and PAC thermodilution was 11 {\%}. When excluding a sole outlier, the bias between the two measures decreased to 0.1 L/min (95 {\%} limits of agreement −0.6 to 0.9 L/min), and the percentage error was reduced to 8 {\%}. The median SVRI measured by USCOM was 22.0 Wood Units (IQR 17.0, 26.8 Wood Units) compared to 22.1 Wood Units (IQR 17.6, 27.4 Wood Units) by PAC thermodilution. Bias (mean difference) between the two methods was −0.6 Wood Units, and the 95 {\%} limits of agreement were −8.2 to 6.9 Wood Units. We found that the estimation of CO and by extension SVRI with USCOM is reliable against pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution in children with normal cardiac anatomy. Given the noninvasive nature of USCOM, speed of measurement, and relative ease of use, it may be useful as a bedside tool for pediatric patients.},

Detection of VT/VF is one of the important step in both automated external defibrillator (AED) and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy. In this paper, we propose a new method for detection and classification of shockable ventricular arrhythmia (VT/VF) and non-shockable ventricular arrhythmia (normal sinus rhythm, ventricular bigeminy, ventricular ectopic beats, and ventricular escape rhythm) episodes from Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) is used to decompose the ECG signal into number of modes or sub-signals. The energy, the renyi entropy and the permutation entropy of first three modes are evaluated and these values are used as diagnostic features. The mutual information based feature scoring is employed to select optimal set of diagnostic features. The performance of the diagnostic features is evaluated using random forest (RF) classifier. Experimental results reveal that, the feature subset derived from mutual information based scoring and the RF classifier produces accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of 97.23 {\%}, 96.54 {\%}, and 97.97 {\%}, respectively. The proposed method is compared with some of the existing techniques for detection of shockable ventricular arrhythmia episodes from ECG.},

The sensors utilize a Hall effect magnetic field sensor to capture the blood pulse waveform. A strap based design is performed to enable reliable capture of large number of cardiac cycles with relative ease. The ability of the transducer to consistently detect the blood pulse is verified by in-vivo trials on few volunteers. A duality of such transducers is utilized to capture the local PWV at the carotid artery. The pulse transit time (PTT) between the two detected pulse waveforms, measured along a small section of the carotid artery, was evaluated using automated algorithms to ensure consistency of measurements. The correlation between the measured values of local PWV and BP was also investigated. The developed transducers provide a reliable, easy modality for detecting pulse waveform on superficial arteries. Such transducers, used for measurement of local PWV, could potentially be utilized for cuffless, continuous evaluation of BP at various superficial arterial sites.},

abstract = {Severe right ventricular (RV) failure is more likely reversible than similar magnitudes of left ventricular (LV) failure and, because reversal of both adaptive remodeling and impaired contractility require most often only short periods of support, the use of temporary RV assist devices (t-RVADs) can be a life-saving therapy option for many patients. Although increased experience with t-RVADs and progresses made in the development of safer devices with lower risk for complications has improved both recovery rate of RV function and patient survival, the mortality of t-RVAD recipients can still be high but it depends mainly on the primary cause of RV failure (RVF), the severity of end-organ dysfunction, and the timing of RVAD implantation, and much less on adverse events and complications related to RVAD implantation, support, or removal. Reduced survival of RVAD recipients should therefore not discourage appropriate application of RVADs because their underuse further reduces the chances for RV recovery and patient survival. The article reviews and discusses the challenges related to the pre-implant and post-implant decision-making processes aiming to get best possible therapeutic results. Special attention is focused on pre-implant RV assessment and prediction of RV improvement during mechanical unloading, patient selection for t-RVAD therapy, assessment of unloading-promoted RV recovery, and prediction of its stability after RVAD removal. Particular consideration is also given to prediction of RVF after LVAD implantation which is usually hampered by the complex interactions between the different risk factors related indirectly or directly to the RV potential for reverse remodeling and functional recovery.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Copyright {\&}{\#}xa9; 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Sensitivity distributions of each possible adjacent pair current excitation pattern for both the homogeneous thoracic model and the heterogeneous thoracic model were evaluated. The results show that thoracic inhomogeneities significantly perturb sensitivity distribution patterns.

abstract = {Continuous monitoring of respiratory patterns and physical activity levels can be useful for remote health management of patients with conditions such as heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In a clinical setting, spirometers serve as the gold standard for monitoring respiratory patterns such as breathing rate and changes in lung volume. However, direct measurements using a spirometer requires placement of a sensor in the patient's airway and is thus infeasible for continuous monitoring in nonclinical, ambulatory settings. Under these conditions, indirect respiration monitoring using electrical impedance plethysmographs (EIP) is more suitable but are susceptible to motion artifacts. In this paper, we investigate whether multichannel EIP can be used to perform virtual spirometry under ambulatory settings. The experiments presented in this paper are based on preliminary data collected from 19 adult human subjects under realistic ambulatory and nonambulatory settings. We first highlight the salient features of the signal acquired from a standard spirometer. We then compare the performance of different biosignal processing algorithms in estimating the spirometer signal using multiple EIP sensors and in the presence of motion artifacts and real-world interferences. We demonstrate that in addition to reliably determining different respiratory patterns and states, multichannel EIP could also be used to reliably extract information regarding different patient physical activity states like bending or stretching.},

abstract = {Fibrotic diseases are among the most serious health issues with severe burdens due to their chronic nature and a large number of patients suffering from the debilitating effects and long-term sequelae. Collagenase treatment is a nonsurgical option but has limited results. To date, there is no potent noninvasive solution for fibrosis. Part of the reason for this is the lack of appropriate in vitro live cell screening tools to assess the efficacy of new therapeutical agents. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a cell-based electrochemical impedance biosensor platform to screen the efficacy of potential antifibrotic compounds. The platform employs a label-free and noninvasive strategy to detect the progression of fibrosis and the potency of the antifibrotic molecules in real-time. The fundamental principle that governs this novel system is that dynamic changes in cell shape and adhesion during fibrosis can be measured accurately by monitoring the changes in the impedance. This is achieved by growing the cells on a transparent interdigitated indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. It was demonstrated by monitoring the efficacy of a model antifibrotic compound, PXS64, on cells collected from patients with Dupuytren's contracture. We confirmed the validity of the developed biochemical impedance biosensor as an tool for in vitro screening of antifibrotic compounds and provided quantitative information on subcellular influences of the examined chemical molecules using correlative microscopy analyses that monitor the average cell area, cell morphology, and the amount and directionality of the deposited extracellular matrix protein collagen and measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ changes.},

abstract = {Objective: This study was conducted to compare the cardiac output by using Electrical Cardiometry (EC), a noninvasive method of continuous cardiac output monitoring during cardiac surgery with pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) derived cardiac output. Design: Prospective observational clinical study. Setting: Cardiac surgery operating room of a tertiary care cardiac center. Participants: Twenty five patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 150 double data of cardiac output were compared with Thermodilution Cardiac Output (TDCO) and Thoracic Electrical Bioimpedance (TEBCO). The TDCO value ranges from 1.8 - 6.9 litre{\textperiodcentered}min−1 with a mean of 4.39 ± 1.16 litre{\textperiodcentered}min−1 and TEBCO ranges from 1.8 - 7.1 litre{\textperiodcentered}min−1 with a mean of 4.21 ± 1.16 litre{\textperiodcentered}min−1. The averaged Bland-Altman analysis for TDCO and TEBCO revealed that a mean bias was 0.18, limit of agreement was −1.25 - 0.89 litre{\textperiodcentered}min−1 and the percentage error (PE) ranged from 22{\%} - 32{\%}. The precision for the TDCO was measured to be ±16.2{\%} and the precision for TEBCO was ±19.6{\%}. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis between TDCO and TEBCO with a cutoff of 15{\%} shows a sensitivity of 84{\%} and specificity of 63 and area under ROC curve of 0.80. Mountain plot between TDCO and TEBCO shows that a median percentile is 0.25 and value of 97.5 percentile is 1.525. Conclusions: The present study indicates that the electric cardiometry device yields numerically comparable results to cardiac outputs derived from the PAC during the cardiac surgery. Therefore, electrical cardiometry can be used to evaluate haemodynamic variables with clinically acceptable accuracy, when invasive methods are to be avoided or not available.},

The present study aimed at comparing the accuracy of the USCOM device with that of the thermodilution technique in patients with septicemia. We conducted a prospective observational study in a medical but noncardiological ICU of a university hospital. Septic adult patients (median age 55 years, median SAPS-II-Score 43 points) on mechanical ventilation and catecholamine support were monitored with USCOM and PiCCO (n = 70). Seventy paired left-sided CO measurements (transaortic access = CO US-A) were obtained. The mean CO US-A were 6.55 l/min (±2.19) versus CO PiCCO 6.5 l/min (±2.18). The correlation coefficient was r = 0.89. Comparison by Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias of -0.36 l/min (±0.99 l/min) leading to a mean percentage error of 29. USCOM is a feasible and rapid method to evaluate CO in septic patients. USCOM does reliably represent CO values as compared to the reference technique based on thermodilution (PiCCO). It seems to be appropriate in situations where CO measurements are most pertinent to patient management. {\textcopyright} 2012 Sophia Horster et al.},

abstract = {Introduction Stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output are important measures in the clinical evaluation of cardiac patients and are also frequently used in research applications. This study was aimed to improve SV scoring derived from spot-electrode based impedance cardiography (ICG) in a pediatric population of healthy volunteers and patients with a corrected congenital heart defect. Methods 128 healthy volunteers and 66 patients participated. First, scoring methods for ambiguous ICG signals were optimized to improve agreement of B- and X-points with aortic valve opening/closure in simultaneously recorded transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Building on the improved scoring of B- and X-points, the Kubicek equation for SV estimation was optimized by testing the agreement with the simultaneously recorded SV by TTE. Both steps were initially done in a subset of the sample of healthy children and then validated in the remaining subset of healthy children and in a sample of patients. Results SV assessment by ICG in healthy children strongly improved (intra class correlation increased from 0.26 to 0.72) after replacing baseline thorax impedance (Z0) in the Kubicek equation by an equation (7.337–6.208 ∗ dZ/dtmax), where dZ/dtmax is the amplitude of the ICG signal at the C-point. Reliable SV assessment remained more difficult in patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusions After proper adjustment of the Kubicek equation, SV assessed by the use of spot-electrode based ICG is comparable to that obtained from TTE. This approach is highly feasible in a pediatric population and can be used in an ambulatory setting.},

Electrical resistive tomography is use in the geophysical imaging is used for searching underground conducting fluid plumes near the surface and obtaining information about rock porosity or fracture formation. Another application of electrical impedance tomography is for example in non-destructive testing and identification of material defects like cracks or identification of corrosion in production materials.

Therefore, attention is paid to the development of non-invasive methods. Tonometry sensors are mostly used for getting the primary pressure information non-invasively from the radial artery. Authors of the paper introduced a method of electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements on the radial artery to create a more robust method than tonometry. The main attention is paid on the synthesis of transfer functions connecting the central aortic and radial blood pressure curves. Finally it is concluded that the bioimpedance sensing method is at least a useful complementary component to the tonometry or can even replace it in the future developments.},

The present paper is a review of some procedures that have contributed to improve spatial resolution and material properties accuracy, admitivity or impeditivity accuracy. A review of EIT medical applications is presented and they were classified into three broad categories: ARDS patients, obstructive lung diseases and perioperative patients. The use of absolute EIT image may enable the assessment of absolute lung volume, which may significantly improve clinical acceptance of EIT. The Control Theory, State Observers more specifically, have a developed theory that can be used for designing and operating EIT devices. Electrode placement, current injection strategy and electrode electric potential measurements strategy should maximize the number of observable and controllable directions of the state vector space. A non-linear stochastic state observer, the Unscented Kalman Filter, is used directly for reconstructing absolute EIT images. Historically, difference images were explored first since they are more stable in the presence of modelling errors. Absolute images require more detailed models of contact impedance, stray capacitance and properly refined finite element mesh, where the electric potential gradient is high. Parallelization of the forward program computation is necessary since the solution of the inverse problem often requires frequent solutions of the forward problem. Several reconstruction algorithms benefit from the Bayesian inverse problem approach and the concept of prior information. Anatomic and physiological information are used to form the prior information. An already tested methodology is presented to build the prior probability density function using an ensemble of CT scans and in vivo impedance measurements. Eight absolute EIT image algorithms are presented.},

abstract = {Aim of this paper is to present a combined impedance plethysmography and spectrometry technique suitable to measure the functionality of the peripheral vascular system, with emphasis on the lower limbs. The plethysmographic investigation allows studying the venous flow by detecting the change in blood volume through an electrical bio-impedance measurement. In particular, such measurement is based on a procedure that does not require the use of an occlusive cuff that might cause a detachment of potential thrombus because of the downstream venous pressure. The spectroscopic investigation, instead, might reveal possible differences in the limb impedance spectrum due to a different resistivity of flowing blood as compared to standing blood: the latter, in particular, might be present in case of vascular diseases. Results obtained on healthy subjects show an increasing impedance in correspondence of blood volume decreases forced by a rise of the limb, and a corresponding decrease in the impedance linked to the leg blood filling as the limb is taken back to its rest position. The two transitions follow an exponential trend with different time constants. For a healthy patient, the bio-impedance of the leg shows a comparable behavior between the two legs, while for a subject with venous thrombosis a longer transient is expected for the affected limb. Similarly, the impedance spectrum of healthy patients shows almost the same frequency behavior for both legs, while possible differences might be detected in case of thrombosis.},

abstract = {Background: Simple, accurate, continuous non-invasive cardiac monitoring during the peri- and postoperative periods for patients at risk of cardiac failure would be very useful. Electrical impedance cardiography (EIC) has been proposed as an accurate method for non-invasive measurement of cardiac function. However, in recent years the accuracy of EIC in stroke Volume (SV) measurement has been questioned and this prevented global acceptance of the method. Beside SV, EIC is capable of measuring several other left ventricular contractility indices, which are measured directly from the impedance signal. The aim of this study was to compare these variables with the echocardiographically derived left ventricular wall motion score (WMS) as the reference method. Methods: In a group of eight coronary artery disease patients we performed a pharmacologically (dobutamine) induced stress test. Echocardiographic and impedance cardiographic recordings were performed simultaneously during four levels of dobutamine infusion. WMS was derived from the simultaneously displayed four-stage echocardiographic image. Results: Analysis of variance showed that the majority of indices changed significantly during the test. Direct correlation with the wall motion score gave very satisfactory results over all stages with the RZ time (r = 0.75, P {\textless} 0.001) and Heather index (r = -0.78, P {\textless} 0.001). Other correlations were substantially lower. Conclusion: The Heather index has to be preferred as indicator of the left ventricular performance. Since EIC is capable of giving continuous information of the left ventricular performance, it might be a valuable method for peri- and postoperative monitoring.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Four trainee operators each performed stroke volume measurements on 25 volunteers, compared to an experienced operator pre- and post-passive leg raise. Inter-rater reliability was then assessed on 24 acute emergency in-patients. Mean percentage difference in stroke volume decreased from 19{\%} (95{\%} confidence intervals 14–23) across volunteers 1–5, to 6{\%} (4–8) for the last 5 volunteers scanned. Consequently, on acute emergency in-patients, excellent inter-rater reliability (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient ($\rho$c) 0.96 (0.92–0.98)) and agreement of a change ≥10{\%} in stroke volume following passive leg raise on 23/24 cases were found. Following a training period of less than 5 h, USCOM stroke volume measurements demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability.},

Impedance plethysmography (IPG) provides a promising low power solution for detecting pulse waves and respiration by measuring the impedance of blood vessels at the wrist. However, the measurement principle makes high demands on the analog front end, due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unknown measurement conditions. In this paper an approach to apply impedance plethysmography is presented. The proposed circuit is based on the impedance measurement IC AD5933 and an adaptive feedback control to regulate current injection and measuring amplification in order to adjust the optimal operating point.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Background: Maintaining threshold values of cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) when used as part of the American College of Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) haemodynamic protocol improves the outcomes in paediatric septic shock. Objective: We observed the evolution of CO and SVR during the intensive care admission of children with fluid-refractory septic shock and report this together with the eventual outcomes. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Tertiary care Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in London. Methods: Children admitted in fluid refractory septic shock to the Intensive Care Unit over a period of 36 months were studied. Post liver re-transplant children and delayed septic shock admissions were excluded. A non-invasive ultrasound cardiac output monitor device (USCOM) was used to measure serial haemodynamics. Children were allocated at presentation into one of two categories: (1) hospital-acquired infection and (2) community-acquired infection. Vasopressor, inotrope or inodilator therapies were titrated to maintain threshold cardiovascular parameters as per the ACCM guidelines. Results: Thirty-six children [19 male, mean age (SD) 6.78 (5.86) years] were admitted with fluid-refractory septic shock and studied. At presentation, all 18 children with hospital-acquired (HA) sepsis and 3 from among the community-acquired (CA) sepsis group were in 'warm shock' (SVRI {\textless} 800 dyne s/cm5/m2) whereas 15 of the 18 children with community-acquired sepsis and none in the hospital-acquired group were in 'cold shock' [cardiac index (CI) {\textless} 3.3 l/min/m2]. All 21 children in 'warm shock' were initially commenced on a vasopressor (noradrenaline). Despite an initial good response, four patients developed low CI and needed adrenaline. Similarly, all 15 children in cold shock were initially commenced on adrenaline. However, two of them subsequently required noradrenaline. Five others needed milrinone as an inodilator. In general, both groups of children had normalised SVRI and CI within 42 h of therapy but required variable doses of vasopressors, inotropes or inodilators in a heterogeneous manner. The overall 28-day survival rate was 88.9 {\%} in both groups. Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) was significantly (p = 0.003) lower in the community-acquired group (mean 51.72 {\%} ± 4.26) when compared to the hospital-acquired group (mean 58.72 {\%} ± 1.36) at presentation but showed steady improvement during therapy. Gram-positive organisms were predominant in blood cultures, 61 {\%} in HA and 56 {\%} in CA groups. Conclusions: In general, we found children with community-acquired septic shock presented in cold shock whereas hospital-acquired septic shock children manifested warm shock. Both types evolved in a heterogeneous manner needing frequent revision of cardiovascular support therapy. However the 28-day survival in both groups was the same at 89 {\%}. Frequent measurements of haemodynamics using non-invasive ultrasound helped in fine tuning cardiovascular therapies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ESICM.},

abstract = {• A theoretical model capable of explaining the relationship between the EMP generated by the heart and the electrocardiographic lead voltages must be based on quantitative knowledge of the resistivities of the tissues of the thorax. At the time this study was undertaken, the most recent investigations of tissue resistivity in living animals were those whose results are summarized in the first three columns of table I. 1 ' 2{\textgreater} 3 More recently, the results summarized in column 4 were published. 4 Differences in results range from 40{\%} for lung to 400{\%} for heart muscle, and no two groups of investigators are in substantial agreement on all measurements. An additional investigation of animal tissue resistivity is reported here and the conclusions are presented in column 5 of table 1. A limited attempt was made to discover the sources of the discrepancies in previously published data. This was done by repeating the reported measurement procedure, by theoretical studies and by reviewing the work of other investigators. Both Kaufman and Johnston, and Schwan and Kay, employed a two-electrode technique. Only the more recent work of the latter group was investigated in detail. The present study appears to explain satisfactorily the existing differences in the reported resistivities of thoracic tissue with the possible exception of lung. Methods Measurements of specific resistance of tissue were carried nut on approximately 50 live, anes-thetized, mongrel dogs weighing from 14 to 30 From the 40 kilos. The anesthetic was 0.5 cc./kilo of pento-bnrbital initially with additional small doses as needed. Observations of intact thorax and arm resistivities were made on eight human subjects. The basic technique employed was that of the four-electrode measurement in which a controlled current was introduced and removed from the specimen being measured by means of two 'cur-rent' electrodes and a resulting potential difference measured between two points on the specimen with two additional 'potential' electrodes. The current electrodes were connected to a circuit shown in figure 1, consisting of a 540 volt battery in series with a 4 megohm resistor and a. manually operated contact. The contact was closed for about 0.1 seconds during the measurement thereby generating a pulse waveform at the potential electrodes with approximately the same frequency spectrum as the QRS complex. A potential difference was measured on the tissue surface by means of two needle electrodes, each connected to an open grid of a cathode follower. The output of the cathode followers supplied the differential input of a Sanborn polyviso recorder which recorded the voltage waveform on heat sensitive paper (fig. 2). The animal was grounded to the electrical system at points remote from the measuring electrodes. Three distinct electrode arrangements were required for the various measurements. These will be designated by the letters A, B, C, as described in the sequel. The four-electrode method was chosen primarily to provide a means of eliminating the effects of contact resistance variations on the measurements. Such effects were made negligible at the potential electrodes by the very high input impedance of the cathode followers and at the current electi'odcs by use of a high voltage in series with a very high resistance as a. current source. The needles used for all potential electrodes insured exact knowledge of their locations on the tissue. The use of a square pulse as the measuring signal permitted detection of unusual polarization or other effects which might have been associated with measurement errors. The entire electrode array was made small whenever this was feasible to minimize the effects of remote tissues on the measurements. Lastly, the same electrode assemblies devised for isotropic tissues proved useful for anisotropie measurements. Electrode set A consisted of four needles whose},

The developed device provides low complexity in the electronics design with a frequency range between 1 kHz and 200 kHz. It is able to register the impedance of blood vessel volume change simultaneously at different locations. Experiments were carried out in vivo by using the four-electrode configuration on human thorax, axillary artery and radial artery.

The impedance data can be later interpreted into the aortic blood pressure wave by using a generalized transfer function.

abstract = {Motion and deformation analysis of the myocardium are of utmost interest in cardiac imaging. Part of the research is devoted to the estimation of the heart function by analysis of the shape changes of the left-ventricular endocardial surface. However, most clinically used shape-based approaches are often two-dimensional (2-D) and based on the analysis of the shape at only two cardiac instants. Three-dimensional (3D) approaches generally make restrictive hypothesis about the actual endocardium motion to be able to recover a point-topoint correspondence between two surfaces. The present work is a first step toward the automatic spatio-temporal analysis and recognition of deformable surfaces. A curvature-based and easily interpr{\'{e}}table description of the surfaces is derived. Based on this description, shape dynamics is first globally estimated through the temporal shape spectra. Second, a regional curvature-based tracking approach is proposed assuming a smooth deformation. It combines geometrical and spatial information in order to analyze a specific endocardial region. These methods are applied both on true 3-D X-ray data and on simulated normal and abnormal left ventricles. The results are coherent and easily interpr{\'{e}}table. Shape dynamics estimations and comparisons between deformable object sequences are now possible through these techniques. This promising framework is a suitable tool for a complete regional description of deformable surfaces. {\textcopyright} 1997 IEEE.},

abstract = {Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a popular bioimpedance application used for the non-invasive evaluation of the left ventricular stroke volume and contractility. It implies the correct determination of ejection start and end points and the amplitudes of certain peaks in a differentiated impedance cardiogram. An accurate identification of ejection onset by ICG is often problematic, especially in cardiologic patients, due to the peculiar character of the waveforms. A simple theoretical model was employed to test the consequences of the hypothesis that two major processes can contribute to the formation of an impedance systolic wave: (1) the pre-ejection changes in heart geometry and the surrounding vessels produced by ventricular contraction during the isovolumic phase, and (2) the expansion of aorta and adjacent arteries during the ejection per se. The former process initiates the pre-ejection wave while the latter triggers the ejection wave, both of which contribute to the impedance pulse waves associated with the heartbeats. A new two-bell model predicts a potential mechanism responsible for the abnormal shapes of ICG derivative dZ/dt due to the presence of the pre-ejection waves and explains the related errors in systolic time intervals and amplitude parameters derived from such ICG waveforms. It also advances an alternative viewpoint on the nature of the dZ/dt B-point notch. An appropriate decomposition method opens a promising way to avoid the masking effects of these waves and to correctly determine the onset of ejection as well as the corresponding peak amplitudes from the 'pathologically shaped' ICG signals. {\textcopyright} 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

However, changes in education policies resulting the teachers to have high workload in the workplace. This is a correlational research, and carried out to identify the relationship between workload and self-efficacy and job satisfaction among lecturers at vocational colleges. A total of 373 questionnaires containing 60 items were collected from the lecturers from 15 vocational colleges which were selected using cluster random sampling technique. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 22. Data were analyzed using t-test, ANOVA and Pearson-r correlation. Results showed that the workload of the lecturers at vocational colleges are at a high level (mean = 3.73), self-efficacy remained at a high level (mean = 3.81) and job satisfaction lecturer at the medium level (mean = 3.57). Based on the analysis, it was found that the workload significantly correlated with self-efficacy and job satisfaction in a negative direction and the strength of the relationship is at the low level. Self-efficacy was found to have a significant relationship with job satisfaction and the strength of the relationship is at the medium level.

We hypothesized that the PEP/LVET measured by ICG would correlate with that measured by echocardiography, and that PEP/LVET measured by ICG would be useful for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) optimization. Methods Newly CRT implanted patients were optimized by echocardiography. The PEP/LVET was measured by echocardiography and ICG in two different settings: optimized setting and right ventricle (RV)-only pacing. Results The PEP/LVET was significantly decreased in the optimized setting compared with that in RV-only pacing (0.62±0.13 vs 0.75±0.16, p{\textless}0.05). The PEP/LVET values calculated by ICG and echocardiography were positively correlated (r=0.553, p=0.003). Conclusion ICG was useful for the optimization of CRT.},

abstract = {Through 17 chapters, this book presents the principle of many advanced biosignal processing techniques. After an important chapter introducing the main biosignal properties as well as the most recent acquisition techniques, it highlights five specific parts which build the body of this book. Each part concerns one of the most intensively used biosignals in the clinical routine, namely the Electrocardiogram (ECG), the Elektroenzephalogram (EEG), the Electromyogram (EMG) and the Evoked Potential (EP). In addition, each part gathers a certain number of chapters related to analysis, detection, classification, source separation and feature extraction. These aspects are explored by means of various advanced signal processing approaches, namely wavelets, Empirical Modal Decomposition, Neural networks, Markov models, Metaheuristics as well as hybrid approaches including wavelet networks, and neuro-fuzzy networks. The last part, concerns the Multimodal Biosignal processing, in which we present two different chapters related to the biomedical compression and the data fusion.Instead organising the chapters by approaches, the present book has been voluntarily structured according to signal categories (ECG, EEG, EMG, EP). This helps the reader, interested in a specific field, to assimilate easily the techniques dedicated to a given class of biosignals. Furthermore, most of signals used for illustration purpose in this book can be downloaded from the Medical Database for the Evaluation of Image and Signal Processing Algorithm. These materials assist considerably the user in evaluating the performances of their developed algorithms. This book is suited for final year graduate students, engineers and researchers in biomedical engineering and practicing engineers in biomedical science and medical physics. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

Current-mode and voltage-mode readouts, integrated on the same chip, can provide an adaptable platform to correlate single-cell biosensor studies with large-scale tissue or organ analysis for real-time cancer detection, imaging and characterization. The chip, implemented in a 180-nm CMOS technology, combines two current-readout (CR) channels and four voltage-readout (VR) channels suitable for both bipolar and tetrapolar electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Each VR channel occupies an area of 0.48 mm2, is capable of an operational bandwidth of 8 MHz and a linear gain in the range between -6 dB and 42 dB. The gain of the CR channel can be set to 10 k$\Omega$, 50 k$\Omega$ or 100 k$\Omega$ and is capable of 80-dB dynamic range, with a very linear response for input currents between 10 nA and 100 $\mu$A. Each CR channel occupies an area of 0.21 mm2. The chip consumes between 530 $\mu$A and 690 $\mu$A per channel and operates from a 1.8-V supply. The chip was used to measure the impedance of capacitive interdigitated electrodes in saline solution. Measurements show close matching with results obtained using a commercial impedance analyser. The chip will be part of a fully flexible and configurable fully-integrated dual-mode EIS system for impedance sensors and bioimpedance analysis.},

abstract = {The present study aimed to assess whether impedance cardiography (IC) can correctly identify the optimal interventricular (VV) pacing interval in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Twenty four patients received a biventricular pacemaker and underwent IC for cardiac output (CO) measurements to identify the optimal VV interval. Invasive measurements of left ventricular (LV) dP/dt max were used as a reference. During optimization the VV interval was changed with 20 ms steps from +80 (LV pre-excitation) to-80 ms (RV pre-excitation). The optimal VV interval was defined as the one that resulted in the highest LV dP/dtmax value and the highest CO obtained by IC, respectively. During simultaneous biventricular pacing both LV dP/dt max and CO increased (mean 16.6{\%} and 16.2{\%}, respectively) as compared to baseline. Biventricular pacing with optimized VV intervals resulted in a further absolute increase of LV dP/dt max and CO (5.6{\%} and 41.3{\%}, respectively). The average decrease in LV dP/dtmax was 79.6∈±∈51.6 mmHg/s when the optimal VV interval was programmed according to the IC measurements. Cross spectral analysis showed no correlation between the optimal VV intervals identified by the two methods (p∈{\textgreater}∈0.05) and identical optimal VV intervals were identified in only six of the 24 patients. When broader VV time intervals were compared the correlation between the two methods was statistically significant (p∈=∈0,0166). In conclusion, the use of IC for VV interval optimization is questionable since these optimized time intervals do not seem to correlate well with those obtained by measuring LV dP/dt. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The century this may be a century of human intelligence, and excellence will be a community that works on the development of thinking of its members. We live in an age characterized by the wealth of scientific and modern technology, and this requires multiple methods of thinking to confront them and try to overcome them. Our vehicle for this is science, science and knowledge are power have become the new world. The building and personal growth of normal primary objectives of the educational process, and each individual's unique and distinctive character which is different from the other individuals. So the current is determined by the importance of research, known ways of thinking's favorite (Sternberg), the extension educators and its relationship to pattern their characters. Target current research to answer the following questions: 1- What ways of thinking favored by Educational counselors in light of the theory (Asternberg) to ways of thinking. 2- Is there a statistically significant correlation between ways of thinking in the light of the theory (Asternberg), Educational counselors in the pattern of their personality (extraversion - introversion), and (neuroticism - stability). To achieve the objectives of the research, the researcher tools are: a list of ways of thinking for (Sternberg) short list, a list (Eisenk) to personal style, and After finding the psychometrical properties for the criterion as, a sample (100) counselors has been tested chosen randomly out of the whole group of counselors (143) who work in secondary and intermediate schools in the General Directorate of Education in Kirkuk. After processing the data concisely using the (t-test, on sample and two samples, the person factor device ). The study comes up with the following conclusion: 1- The most favored ways of thinking among members of the sample are ways of thinking (hierarchical, liberal, estoppel, PLC). 2- there was no statistically significant relationships between overlapping ways of thinking according to the theory (Sternberg), and personal style according to the theory (Eisenk), for members of the research sample, except in the two methods are the only two methods (local and Royal). We conclude from this that there are relationships between the function's ways of thinking (Sternberg), and personal characteristics. In light of these results, the researcher recommends taking advantage of the tools in the development of outreach programs develop positive ways of thinking and patterns of personal individuals.

abstract = {Piezoresistive accelerometer signals are frequently used in movement analysis. However, their use and interpretation are complicated by the fact that the signal is composed of different acceleration components. The aim of the study was to obtain insight into the components of accelerometer signals from the trunk and thigh segments during four different sit-to-stand (STS) movements (self-selected, slow, fast and fullflexion). Nine subjects performed at least six trials of each type of STS movement. Accelerometer signals from the trunk and thigh in the sagittal direction were decomposed using kinematic data obtained from an opto-electronic device. Each acceleration signal was decomposed into gravitational and inertial components, and the inertial component of the trunk was subsequently decomposed into rotational and translational components. The accelerometer signals could be reliably reconstructed: mean normalised root mean square (RMS) trunk: 6.5{\%} (range 3-12{\%}), mean RMS thigh: 3{\%} (range 2-5{\%}). The accelerometric signals were highly characteristic and repeatable. The influence of the inertial component was significant, especially on the timing of the specific event of maximum trunk flexion in the accelerometer signal. The effect of inertia was larger in the trunk signal than in the thigh signal and increased with higher speeds. The study provides insight into the acceleration signal, its components and the influence of the type of STS movement and supports its use in STS movement analysis. {\textcopyright} IFMBE: 2005.},

abstract = {Background: New sensors for intelligent remote monitoring of the heart should be developed. Recently, a cutaneous force-frequency relation recording system has been validated based on heart sound amplitude and timing variations at increasing heart rates. Aim: To assess sensor-based post-exercise contractility, diastolic function and pressure in normal and diseased hearts as a model of a wireless telemedicine system. Methods: We enrolled 150 patients and 22 controls referred for exercise-stress echocardiography, age 55 ± 18 years. The sensor was attached in the precordial region by an ECG electrode. Stress and recovery contractility were derived by first heart sound amplitude vibration changes; diastolic times were acquired continuously. Systemic pressure changes were quantitatively documented by second heart sound recording. Results: Interpretable sensor recordings were obtained in all patients (feasibility = 100{\%}). Postexercise contractility overshoot (defined as increase {\textgreater} 10{\%} of recovery contractility vs exercise value) was more frequent in patients than controls (27{\%} vs 8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05). At 100 bpm stress heart rate, systolic/diastolic time ratio (normal, {\textless} 1) was {\textgreater} 1 in 20 patients and in none of the controls (p {\textless} 0.01); at recovery systolic/diastolic ratio was {\textgreater} 1 in only 3 patients (p {\textless} 0.01 vs stress). Postexercise reduced arterial pressure was sensed. Conclusion: Post-exercise contractility, diastolic time and pressure changes can be continuously measured by a cutaneous sensor. Heart disease affects not only exercise systolic performance, but also post-exercise recovery, diastolic time intervals and blood pressure changes - in our study, all of these were monitored by a non-invasive wearable sensor. {\textcopyright} 2009 Bombardini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the primary arrhythmic event in the majority of patients suffering from sudden cardiac arrest. Attention has been focused on this particular rhythm since it is recognized that prompt therapy, especially electrical defibrillation, may lead to a successful outcome. However, current versions of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) mandate repetitive interruptions of chest compression for rhythm analyses since artifacts produced by chest compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) preclude reliable electrocardiographic (ECG) rhythm analysis. Yet, repetitive interruptions in chest compression are detrimental to the success of defibrillation. The capability for rhythm analysis without requiring hands-off intervals will allow for more effective resuscitation. In this paper, a novel continuous-wavelet-transformation-based morphology consistency evaluation algorithm was developed for the detection of disorganized VF from organized sinus rhythm (SR) without interrupting the ongoing chest compression. The performance of this method was evaluated on both uncorrupted and corrupted ECG signals recorded from AEDs obtained from out-of-hospital victims of cardiac arrest. A total of 232 patients and 31092 episodes of either VF or SR were accessed, in which 8195 episodes were corrupted by artifacts produced by chest compressions. We also compared the performance of this method with three other established algorithms, including VF filter, spectrum analysis, and complexity measurement. Even though there was a modest decrease in specificity and accuracy when chest compression artifact was present, the performance of this method was still superior to other reported methods for VF detection during uninterrupted CPR. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Consequently, reliable non-invasive estimation of the cardiac output could have far-reaching benefit. Methods: This study compared a non-invasive Doppler device – the ultrasonic cardiac output monitor (USCOM) – with the oesophageal Doppler monitor (ODM), on 25 patients during major abdominal surgery. Stroke volume was determined by USCOM (SVUSCOM) and ODM (SVODM) pre and post fluid challenges. Results: A ≥ 10{\%} change ($\Delta$) SVUSCOM had a sensitivity of 94{\%} and specificity of 88{\%} to detect a ≥ 10{\%} $\Delta$ SVODM; the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.94 (95{\%} CI 0.90–0.99). Concordance was 98{\%}, using an exclusion zone of {\textless}10{\%} $\Delta$ SVODM. 135 measurements gave median SVUSCOM 80 ml (interquartile range 65–93 ml) and SVODM 86 ml (69–100 ml); mean bias was 5.9 ml (limits of agreement −20 to +30 ml) and percentage error 30{\%}.

This study is the first in comparing this non-invasive technique in measuring stroke volume with established techniques. The objective of this study was to validate EIT variables derived from the EIT images with paired obtained stroke volume measurements by thermodilution and MRI. After right cardiac catheterization, EIT measurements were performed in 25 patients. Regression analysis was used to analyse the relation between the EIT results and stroke volume determined by thermodilution. From the regression line an equation was derived to estimate stroke volume (in ml) by EIT. A strong correlation was found between EIT and stroke volume measured by the thermodilution method (r = 0.86). In a group of 11 healthy subjects this equation was validated to MRI. The mean and standard deviation of the difference between EIT and MRI was 0.7 ml and 5.4 ml respectively. These data indicate that EIT is a valid and reproducible method for the assessment of stroke volume.},

In scientific literature there exists a wide variety of methods and ideas for handling this task. These algorithms should have a high detection quality, be easily implementable, and work in realtime in an AED. Testing of these algorithms should be done by using a large amount of annotated data under equal conditions. For our investigation we simulated a continuous analysis by selecting the data in steps of 1 s without any preselection. We used the complete BIH-MIT arrhythmia database, the CU database, and files 7001-8210 of the AHA database. For a new VF detection algorithm we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and the area under its receiver operating characteristic curve and compared these values with the results from an earlier investigation of several VF detection algorithms. This new algorithm is based on time-delay methods and outperforms all other investigated algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Sinus rhythm (SR), ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) belong to different nonlinear physiological processes with different complexity. In this study, we present a novel, and computationally fast method to detect VT and VF, which utilizes a complexity measure suggested by Lempel and Ziv [1]. For a specific window length (i.e., the length of data segment to be analyzed), the method first generates a 0-1 string by comparing the raw electrocardiogram (ECG) data to a selected suitable threshold. The complexity measure can be obtained from the 0-1 string only using two simple operations, comparison and accumulation. When the window length is 7 s, the detection accuracy for each of SR, VT, and VF is 100{\%} for a test set of 204 body surface records (34 SR, 85 monomorphic VT, and 85 VF). Compared with other conventional time- and frequency-domain methods, such as rate and irregularity, VF-filter leakage, and sequential hypothesis testing, the new algorithm is simple, computationally efficient, and well suited for real-time implementation in automatic external defibrillators (AED's).},

abstract = {Under the alternating electrical excitation, biological tissues produce a complex electrical impedance which depends on tissue composition, structures, health status, and applied signal frequency, and hence the bioelectrical impedance methods can be utilized for noninvasive tissue characterization. As the impedance responses of these tissue parameters vary with frequencies of the applied signal, the impedance analysis conducted over a wide frequency band provides more information about the tissue interiors which help us to better understand the biological tissues anatomy, physiology, and pathology. Over past few decades, a number of impedance based noninvasive tissue characterization techniques such as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), electrical impedance plethysmography (IPG), impedance cardiography (ICG), and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) have been proposed and a lot of research works have been conducted on these methods for noninvasive tissue characterization and disease diagnosis. In this paper BIA, EIS, IPG, ICG, and EIT techniques and their applications in different fields have been reviewed and technical perspective of these impedance methods has been presented.The working principles, applications,merits, and demerits of these methods has been discussed in detail along with their other technical issues followed by present status and future trends.},

The MPG transducers (positioned at 23 mm distance apart) utilizes Hall-effect sensors and permanent magnets for arterial blood pulse detection. Methods: The MPG probe was initially validated on an arterial flow phantom using a reference method. Further, 20 normotensive subjects (14 males, age = 24 ± 3.5 years) were studied under two different physical conditions: 1) Physically relaxed condition, 2) Postexercise condition. Local PWV was measured from the left carotid artery using the MPG probe. Brachial blood pressure (BP) was measured to investigate the correlation of BP with local PWV. Results: The proposed MPG arterial compliance probe was capable of detecting high-fidelity blood pulse waveforms. Reliable local pulse transit time estimates were assessed by the developed measurement system. Beat-by-beat local PWV was measured from multiple subjects under different physical conditions. A profound increment was observed in the carotid local PWV for all subjects after exercise (average increment = 0.42 ± 0.22 m/s). Local PWV values and brachial BP parameters were significantly correlated (r ≥ 0.72), except for pulse pressure (r = 0.42). Conclusion: MPG arterial compliance probe for local PWV measurement was validated. Carotid local PWV measurement, its variations due to physical exercise and correlation with BP levels were examined during the in vivo study. Significance: A novel dual MPG probe for local PWV measurement and potential use in cuffless BP measurement.},

A great many methods and devices are now used over the world, and this article focuses on several of them, providing with a brief review of related underlying physical principles and validation articles analysis. Reviewed methods include electrical bioimpedance and bioreactance, respiratory-derived cardiac output (CO) monitoring technique, pulse wave transit time, ultrasound CO monitoring, multimodal algorithmic estimation, and inductance thoracocardiography. Quality criteria with which devices were reviewed included: accuracy (closeness of agreement between a measurement value and a true value of the measured), precision (closeness of agreement between replicate measurements on the same or similar objects under specified conditions), and step response change (delay between physiological change and its indication). Our conclusion is that the offer of non-invasive monitoring has improved in the past few years, even though further developments are needed to provide clinicians with sufficiently accurate devices for routine use, as alternative to invasive monitoring devices.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Three experimental techniques based on automatic swept-frequency network and impedance analysers were used to measure the dielectric properties of tissue in the frequency range 10 Hz to 20 GHz. The technique used in conjunction with the impedance analyser is described. Results are given for a number of human and animal tissues, at body temperature, across the frequency range, demonstrating that good agreement was achieved between measurements using the three pieces of aquipment. Moreover, the measured values fall well within the body of corresponding literature data.},

abstract = {In this paper the determination of the positions of surface plate electrodes on human trunk for measuring the breathing and heart rate by using the electrical bioimpedance is presented. The designed and implemented measurement device - electrode shirt - is described. The novelty of current work is incorporated into the solution of placing the large surface plate electrodes into the garment. Focus is set on the capacitive connection to the object, revealing the problems of the influence of motions and displacement of the electrodes to the result. The best configurations for heart rate are showing the portion of change of the real part of total body impedance up to 5 percent. The result concerning the breathing rate is showing promising results, reaching up to 90 percent of real part of total body impedance. The best determined electrode placement configurations are showing the possibility of detecting the breathing and heart rate by using single electrode placement.},
